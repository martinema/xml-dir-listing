# XML Directory Listing #

**The XML Directory Listing application recursively searches a given directory, and generates an XML file representing the directory structure.**

  * Configurable XML output.
  * Files can be included or excluded from output.
  * Cross platform [Java](http://java.sun.com) application.
  * [SAX](http://sax.sourceforge.net) based parsing for low memory footprint and fast execution time.
  * Easy [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) integration via custom task.
