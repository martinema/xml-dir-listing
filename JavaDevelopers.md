## XmlDirectoryListing in Java apps ##

Please feel free to use the XmlDirectoryListing class in your Java applications. The binary distribution comes with a Javadoc API.

The class uses [log4j](http://logging.apache.org) which can be extended in your application.

The [Doctype](http://xml-dir-listing.googlecode.com/svn/tags/version_0.1/lib/xml-dir-listing.dtd) may also be of interest.
